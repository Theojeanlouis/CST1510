"""

# ====================================================================== CLASS
# 1. Define a class called Record.
#
#    Threshold : __init__(self, label, value, limit) storing all three as
#                attributes. No methods yet.
#    Typical   : add a method status(self) that returns "OVER LIMIT" (100%+),
#                "WARNING" (90%+) or "OK", worked out from self.value and
#                self.limit. Give it a one-line docstring.
#    Excellent : also add over_limit_count as a class-level running total -
#                see the note below.

# your class goes here
class Record:
    over_limit_count=0
    def __init__(self, label,value,limit): #assigning attributes to the class
        self.label=label
        self.value=value
        self.limit=limit

    def status(self):
        """returns a status depending on value and limit"""
        p=(self.value/self.limit)* 100
        if p>= 100:
            Record.over_limit_count+=1
            return "OVER LIMIT"
        elif p>= 90:
            return "WARNING"
        else:
            return "OK"
# ==================================================================== RECORDS
# 2. Create your records.
#
#    Threshold : create at least 2 Record instances directly in the code.
#    Typical   : same, but now print each one's .status() as well.
#    Excellent : instead, write load_records(path) that reads label,value,limit
#                lines from a file and returns a list of Record objects. Make
#                your own data file, one record per line.

    
records = [] 
def load_records(path):
    """"looping through a file and appending its content as label,value,limit into a list"""
    with open(path) as f:
        for line in f:
            label, value, limit=line.strip().split(",")
            records.append(Record(label, float(value), float(limit)))
    return records

# ==================================================================== OUTPUT
# 3. Print a report for each record.
#
#    Threshold : label, value, limit, inside a border.
#    Typical   : add the result of .status().
#    Excellent : also keep a running count of how many came back OVER LIMIT
#                across every record, and print that once, after the loop.
#                (Simplest: a plain variable outside the loop, same pattern
#                as Week 4. If you want it to live ON the object instead,
#                that is a stretch worth trying - but a variable is enough.)
load_records("testing.txt")
for record in records:
    print()
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {record.label}")
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"Value :{record.value:>10.2f}")
    print(f"Limit :{record.limit:>10.2f}")
    print(f"status:{record.status():>10} ")

    print("=" * 34)

print(f"{Record.over_limit_count} of {len(records)} were OVER LIMIT")
# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it and check every record's numbers by hand
#    [ ] Check every method only reads/changes its OWN object (self) -
#        nothing reaches outside itself
#    [ ] Check every method and __init__ has a one-line docstring
